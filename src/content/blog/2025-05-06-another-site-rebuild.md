## Background

After almost 10 years building websites, this site has been the one I've rebuilt the most. I'm never 100% happy with how it looks and what is on here, but today that all changes... maybe. (I'm sure this site will be rebuilt again in a couple years).

Years ago, as a soon-to-be university graduate eager for my first dev gig, I needed something eye-catching to land my first dev gig. Whether the site at the time helped in that or not, I managed to land a solid job a couple days before finishing up university. Even after securing my first web dev job, I continued redesigning, rebuilding and updating this site, with no real purpose but for something to point to when people asked what I did. It became a portfolio site for friends and family, and whoever else stumbled across it.

A couple years back I started up a separate site with a few tutorial/blog style posts. It purposely sat separate from this site as it was more informative and less "showcasey". These posts have been migrated to this site and now live [here](/blog). Their old home was fine - nothing wrong with it - but after some thinking, it didn't really make sense having two separate sites.

## The spark

The main driver to the new site design was a blog post I found late into the AM at the start of 2025, [This page is under construction: A love letter to the personal website](https://localghost.dev/blog/this-page-is-under-construction/). 

> If you take just one thing away from this article, I want it to be this: **please build your own website**. A little home on the independent web.

Even though I'm relatively young and didn’t experience the GeoCities and MySpace revolution firsthand, I have still built my fair share of websites over the past 10yrs+. I can appreciate that a personal website can be more than just a portfolio site, it can be *anything* you want it to be.

## Maybe build your own site?

I'd encourage anyone and everyone to build a personal site. Even if it's only to appreciate the art of building a website, HTML/CSS and maybe some JavaScript. Tools like [Astro](https://astro.build/) (this site is currently built with) or [11ty](https://11ty.dev) are great places to start. It doesn't have to be fancy, it doesn't need RSS feeds, funky animations, light/dark mode switches. It could be a vanilla HTML page sharing a few thoughts about something you're passionate about, hobbies or just life.

Another approach would be to use tools like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/), [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) or [SquareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com/). These days it's fairly easy to get a simple site up and running without requiring prior development or design knowledge.

## Back to the spark

With this spark lit, I embarked on rebuilding my portfolio site (again) - turning it into a more personal website. This site is now full of [photographs](/photography) from the last 20yrs+ (not *all* of them, but some of my favourites), [blog posts](/blog) I'd previously hosted elsewhere (and a home for new ones), and a more personalised spin on the previous content hosted on this site.

## Final thoughts

I'm still not 100% sure on the direction I'll take this site, but we'll see where it goes. For now, enjoy the content here, and keep an eye out for future updates – you can subscribe via [RSS](/rss) if that’s your thing.
